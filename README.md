# Discrete event simulator

## Description

> The large floating-point numbers are due to python truncation.

> *The __snapshots.txt__ contains a single run for n=6 with the given numbers in the slides.*

> The simulator is able to generate and work with random numbers, but due to the requirement of the assignment the *arrival_times* and *service_times* are assigned as given in the assignment.

Run command:
```shell
$ python main.py
```

> The implementation, generates snapshots identical to slides (starting from snapshot 2 of the slides).
